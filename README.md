# Fundamentals_of_Programming
Repo that stores all my programs from the course Fundamentals of Programming at Taltech faculty of Cyber Security Engineering. The course was called "Fundamentals of Programming". Some files are in .cpp extension due to the compiler used, our teacher taught us the C programming language using a C++ compiler.
